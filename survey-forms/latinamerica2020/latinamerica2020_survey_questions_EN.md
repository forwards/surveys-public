# Latin America survey 2020 - English Version

Welcome to the 2020 Latin America survey for R users, conducted by [Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), the R Foundation's working group for women and underrepresented groups. 

This survey is aimed at all people born in Latin America (whether or not currently live in Latin America) and who use, have used or want to use R, organize RUGs or chapters of R-Ladies, are tutors, students, speakers, authors of books, packages, code, blog posts, podcasts or any activity related to the language in our region. If you've ever read a line of code written in R or would like to learn how to read it, this survey is for you.

If you were not born in Latin America, but is your current place of residence and you relate to R in one of the ways already described, we would also like you to complete this survey.

This survey includes questions regarding personal and potentially identifiable information. We ask these questions because we are actively working to improve the inclusiveness and openness of the R community. Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and focus our efforts where needed. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers are recorded (e.g.: name, email, IP address). We estimate that it should take you less than 10 minutes to complete this survey.
