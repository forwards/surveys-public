# Latin America survey 2020 - English Version

Welcome to the 2020 Latin America useR survey, conducted by [Forwards](https://forwards.github.io), the R Foundation's working group for women and underrepresented groups. 

This survey is aimed at all people born in Latin America (whether or not currently resident) and who use, have used or want to use R, organize RUGs or chapters of R-Ladies, are tutors, students, speakers, authors of books, packages, code, blog posts, podcasts or any activity related to the language in our region. If you've ever read a line of code written in R or would like to learn how to read it, this survey is for you.

This survey includes questions regarding personal and potentially identifiable information. We ask these questions because the R community is actively working to improve the inclusiveness and openness of our online and offline spaces. Taking snapshots of demographic data allows us to see how we're doing over time, and adjust accordingly if the results suggest our events are excluding certain demographics. The legal basis for processing this data is your consent.

Please note that all questions are optional and no explicit identifiers are recorded (eg: name, email, IP address). We estimate that it should take you less than 10 minutes to complete this survey.
